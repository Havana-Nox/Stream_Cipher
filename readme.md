# 🔐 Stream Cipher

> Lightweight Java implementation of a stream cipher encryption system.

🧪 This project demonstrates simple symmetric encryption using a custom stream cipher written in Java.  
It includes a basic GUI (Swing-based) for testing and visualizing the encryption/decryption process in real time.
